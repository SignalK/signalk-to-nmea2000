Plugin to convert Signal K to NMEA2000

Currently only support apparent wind, gps location and system time.

Requires that toChildProcess be set to nmea2000out for the actisense execute provider:

```
     {
      "id": "actisense",
      "pipeElements": [{
        "type": "providers/execute",
        "options": {
          "command": "actisense-serial /dev/ttyUSB0",
          "toChildProcess": "nmea2000out"
        }
      }
```

Note that if you're using an NGT-1 to transmit AIS, then you need to use their Windows [NMEA Reader](https://www.actisense.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Actisense-NMEA-Reader-v1.517-Setup.exe_.zip) software to add the pgns (129794, 129038, 129041) in the transmitted list.
